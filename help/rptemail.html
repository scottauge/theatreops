<body>
<p>This takes a letter and sends it as an email.  The message will appear in the bodyof the email, not as an attachment. </p>
<p>This means you need to be concerned about off the email items - such as images, etc. These need to be made available on a public server in order for email readers to see it.</p>
<p>The email will go out under the &quot;ReturnEmail&quot; set in the parameters screen.</p>
