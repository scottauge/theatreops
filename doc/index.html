            <td>I was a member of the Board of Directors of a live
              theatre.&nbsp; Everything was on paper when it comes to
              memberships - and that paper would disappear quite often.&nbsp;
              Being a programmer, I decided to <i>start</i> writing software
              that can be used for theatre operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes,
              inventory too!<br>
              Yes, I know it is ugly, but focus was on having run-able
              software.&nbsp; I plan on making it a little more easier on the
              eyes.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
              But inventory is worth money and stuff disappears as shows start
              because they all grab what they think they need.&nbsp; So we'll
              have a check out of inventory to show.&nbsp; Plus, it'll help ID
              what is the theatre's and what is theirs. :)<br>
              <br>
              I know of other theaters that are missing this kind of software -
              basically a mix of CRM and Inventory/Show allocation.&nbsp; If you
